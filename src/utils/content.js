      body: "Anti-D Immunoglobulin is purified human IgG anti-RhD, manufactured from the plasma of donors who have been deliberately immunised against the RhD antigen. It is a passive immunisation: the antibodies are supplied ready-made, they do not teach the mother's immune system anything, and they clear any RhD-positive red cells from her circulation before her own immune system can mount a memory response.",

      title: "Why it is needed — the Rh problem",
      body: "About 15% of people are RhD-negative. When an RhD-negative mother carries an RhD-positive baby, a small fetomaternal haemorrhage during pregnancy or delivery can push fetal red cells into the maternal circulation. Without Anti-D, roughly 16% of these women will become sensitised: they make permanent anti-D antibodies. Those antibodies cross the placenta in the NEXT pregnancy and destroy the baby's red cells — causing anaemia, hydrops fetalis, kernicterus or stillbirth.",

  faq: [
    { q: "I already received Anti-D at 28 weeks. Do I still need it after delivery?", a: "Yes. The antenatal dose only protects the weeks it was given for. A separate postnatal dose within 72 hours of birth is required whenever the baby is RhD-positive or the baby's group is unknown." },
    { q: "My husband is RhD-negative too. Do I still need Anti-D?", a: "If paternity is certain and the father is truly RhD-negative, the fetus will be RhD-negative and prophylaxis is unnecessary. In practice most guidelines still recommend it unless the father's group is confirmed, because a single missed dose risks every future pregnancy." },
    { q: "It has been more than 72 hours. Is it too late?", a: "Give it anyway. Protection declines but does not vanish — evidence supports benefit up to 28 days after the event. Do not withhold a late dose." },
    { q: "Does Anti-D harm the baby?", a: "No. Anti-D does not cross into the fetus in a clinically meaningful amount and has an excellent safety record over five decades of use. The small amount that does cross can cause a weakly positive direct antiglobulin test in the newborn, which is harmless." },
    { q: "Can Anti-D be given with other vaccines?", a: "Yes, including live attenuated vaccines. Use a separate syringe and a separate injection site. Rubella vaccine given postpartum alongside Anti-D is standard practice." },
    { q: "Where can I get it in Bangladesh?", a: "Anti-D is available in most district and upazila health complexes and in private hospitals. BloodOra's medical shop lists Rhophylac Anti-D 300 mcg under the Medicine category; you can order it for ৳10 delivery inside Kalai Upazila." },

Drink 500 mL of water in the hour before donation; this alone measurably reduces vasovagal reactions. Avoid fatty food immediately before, as lipaemic plasma can make the unit unusable. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before and after. Iron-rich foods in the weeks before donation — liver, red meat, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals, plus vitamin C to boost absorption — reduce the chance of a low-haemoglobin deferral.

Your genotype determines the antigens on your red cells: AA or AO expresses A, BB or BO expresses B, AB expresses both, and OO expresses neither. RhD is a separate gene where D is dominant over d. This is why two A+ parents can have an O− child: both are AO and Dd, so a quarter of their children inherit O from each parent and d from each parent. Antigen frequencies differ by population — in Bangladesh roughly 33% are O+, 28% A+, 25% B+, 12% AB+, and only about 7% of the population is RhD-negative, which is why RhD-negative donors are always urgently needed.",

The two must agree — a discrepancy is the most common cause of a delayed blood-bank report. RhD typing uses anti-D reagent; a weak reaction may indicate the weak-D variant, which requires indirect antiglobulin testing. The antibody screen detects unexpected red-cell antibodies (anti-Kell, anti-E, anti-c and so on) that can cause delayed haemolytic reactions. The cross-match is the final safety step: donor red cells are mixed with the recipient's plasma and must show no agglutination. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs) checks whether antibodies are already coating the patient's own red cells — it is positive in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and in HDFN.",

Transfusion is indicated for significant bleeding — gastrointestinal, mucosal or intracranial — regardless of the count, and is considered prophylactically only below 10,000–20,000/µL with additional risk factors. The mainstay of dengue management is careful fluid management: isotonic crystalloid titrated to the haematocrit and urine output, with strict avoidance of over-hydration, which causes pulmonary oedema. Because platelets are stored at room temperature for only 5 days, dengue season creates acute shortages — a single patient may need 10–20 units.

Excellent sources are beef liver (6 mg per 100 g), red meat, chicken, fish, lentils (3.3 mg per 100 g), chickpeas, tofu, pumpkin seeds, dark leafy greens and iron-fortified cereals. Absorption improves dramatically with vitamin C — add lemon, guava, amloki or orange to the meal. Absorption is blocked by tea and coffee (tannins), calcium-rich dairy taken at the same meal, and some antacids; keep these at least an hour away from your iron-rich meal. Frequent donors, menstruating women and vegetarians should ask for a low-dose daily or alternate-day iron supplement — alternate-day dosing actually absorbs better than daily dosing because it avoids the hepcidin rebound.",

A single simple test — haemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC, costing only a few hundred taka — identifies carriers before marriage. Two carriers can still marry and have healthy children with prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester. Because thalassaemia patients consume a large and permanent share of the blood supply, every voluntary donor directly supports them.

Nucleic-acid testing (NAT), where available, shortens the window period dramatically: from about 22 days for HIV antibody testing to roughly 10 days, and from 70 to 20 days for hepatitis C.

Bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell donation treats leukaemia, aplastic anaemia and thalassaemia major; a matched unrelated donor is found through HLA typing, and collection is now usually by apheresis rather than a marrow harvest. Umbilical cord blood, collected painlessly after delivery, is a rich source of stem cells and is wasted in almost every birth in Bangladesh. Cornea donation after death can restore sight to two people and requires only the family's consent within 6 hours. Registering as a voluntary blood donor on BloodOra is the fastest way to be reachable for all of these.",
